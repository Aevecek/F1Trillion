# **Lidar Collision Avoidance**

## **Overview**
**Purpose:**  
This package enables a robot to move forward until it reaches an obstacle. When the LiDAR sensor detects an obstacle, the robot stops until the obstacle is removed, at which point it resumes forward movement.

**Notes:**  
You can find additional documentation and detailed information here: [Google Docs - Lidar Collision Avoidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VHQcTIyBjwy3DfpB9f3TBZ0Q-jcx_eLJVC8xMbHrpH8/edit?usp=sharing)
